            <h1>LIONEL MESSI JOINS RARE TERRITORY BY SCORING 700TH CAREER CLUB GOAL</h1>
            <p>
              Lionel Messi added another milestone to his already prestigious résumé on Sunday. The all-time great
              scored his 700th career club goal in Paris St. Germain's 3-0 win over Marseille. Messi's milestone goal
              came in the 29th minute of Sunday's match when he received a cross from Kylian Mbappé in the center of the
              box, tapping the ball into the net from just a few yards out. The Argentinian striker was mobbed by his
              PSG teammates following the goal.
